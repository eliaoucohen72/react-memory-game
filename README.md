# React Memory Game

## Description

This project is a **memory game** built with React, using **Vite.js** for project configuration. The objective of the game is to flip two cards at a time and find all the matching pairs among the face-down cards. The game board is a 4x4 grid of images, and the cards are shuffled for each new game.

## Features

- **Card Shuffling**: Each new game shuffles the cards.
- **Card Matching**: The player must find all matching pairs.
- **Simple and Responsive Interface**: The game adapts to different screen sizes and is centered in the middle of the window.
- **Card Flip Effect**: Cards flip when clicked, and matching pairs remain face-up.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite.js**: Fast development build tool for modern web applications.
- **CSS**: For styling the app, using Flexbox and Grid for layout.
- **JavaScript (TypeScript)**: Game logic and state management.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher) must be installed on your machine.
